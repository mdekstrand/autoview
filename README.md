# Automatically View Files

The `autoview` program enables easy, automatic viewing of a wide range of files
in the terminal.  Say goodbye to juggling `ls` and `cat` as you find and examine
files in a deep tree, or to trying to remember which program you need just to
look at the metadata or first few lines of some file.
